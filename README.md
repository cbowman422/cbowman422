# ðŸ‘‹Â Hello and Welcome!

I'm currently working for [Scott's Landscaping, Inc.](https://github.com/cbowman422/scottslandscaping), working as a software engineering freelancer, and learning C++.

## About Me

Software engineer with an aptitude for learning new skills quickly. Strong team player who has contributed to multiple teams and helped drive the design and development of many full-stack applications. In addition to software development, I gained valuable experience in solving difficult and ambiguous problems as a mechanical engineer. Motivated self-starter committed to continuous improvement and staying up-to-date with industry trends.
